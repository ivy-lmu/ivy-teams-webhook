# ivy-teams-webhook example
Configure an incoming webhook in Microsoft Teams as described here https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook.

Then copy the resulting webhook url and replace the placeholder value of `webhookUrl` in https://github.com/ivy-lmu/ivy-teams-webhook/blob/main/config/variables.yaml.

Now you can run the examples in DemoWebhook.p.json.
